Recent studies have shown that twenty percent of lncRNAs could physically associate with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and many lncRNAs could change PRC2 genomic location (17, 18). To evaluate whether PVT1 could also bind PRC2 and affect gene expression in such a manner, we used in vitro transcribed biotin-labeled PVT1 to pull down endogenous proteins associated with PVT1. Biotinlabeled PVT1 was incubated with HeLa cell lysates, followed by protein extraction and detection by Western blot with an antibody against EZH2 (an important subunit of the PRC2). The results showed a significant enrichment of EZH2 (but not b-actin) in the presence of PVT1 compared with antisense RNA (negative control) (Fig. 3A). In addition, we performed RIP assays to further confirm the association between PVT1 and EZH2 (Fig. 3B). EZH2 has been shown to induce histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) on the miR200b promoter and silence miR-200b expression (35). miR-200b has been reported to have a critical role in many cancer cells proliferation and migration (36, 37). So we next determine the functional relevance of the association between PVT1 and EZH2 on miR-200b. ChIP assays showed that enhanced expression of PVT1 promoted the binding of EZH2 and increased H3K27me3 levels on the miR-200b promoter (Fig. 3C). PVT1 knockdown inhibited the binding of EZH2 and decreased H3K27me3 levels on the miR-200b promoter (Fig. 3D). Analysis with RT-PCR showed that overexpression of PVT1 inhibited miR-200b expression, and while depletion of PVT1 increased miR200b expression (Fig. 3E,F). These data demonstrated that through associating with EZH2, PVT1 promoted the binding of EZH2 on the miR200b promoter, upregulated H3K27me3 levels on the miR-200b promoter, and silenced miR-200b expression.
